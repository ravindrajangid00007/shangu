                        The Legends of Shangu originated from the ancient tale of the Jade Emperor who sent an immortal being to Earth to build an army of beasts to protect the heavenly gate from Nian, the Lord of the underworld, whose goal is to unleash evil on the world with his Army of Mutants.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Jade Emperor created a challenge to discover which of Earth's beings would have the skills to protect the world and just like this, the Legends were born. Each animal was given 1 of 4 legendary powers to complete their mission and was given the responsibility of finding the ancient artifacts needed which allowed them to send Nian back to the underworld and after an epic battle, peace was restored…
